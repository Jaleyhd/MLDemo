    "## Hidden Markov Model\n",
    "Hidden Markov Model is a generative model, which is used in modelling hidden States of an observed sequence of events. Markovian Property is crutial in the whole process and states thats that if I know a previous state, my current state won't depend on dependencies of previous states anymore or it will become conditionally independent of ancestoral dependences of its previous states (conditioned on knowledge of previous state). There is a huge amount of resource avaiable for understanding Markovian Models, so I won't go into extreme details.  \n",
